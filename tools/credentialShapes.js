// Ported from vsc_AgentFarm (X-115). THE SHAPES A REAL CREDENTIAL HAS, in one
// place, read by the commit hook (tools/scan_staged.js) and by the tracked-file
// sweep (test/test_credentials.js).
// Two copies of this list would drift, and the one that drifted would be the
// one guarding the surface nobody was looking at.
//
// ‼️ The vendors' own prefixes with a body long enough that a placeholder in a
// doc (`sk-ant-...`, `ghp_xxxx`) does not match: a check that cries wolf on the
// documentation gets switched off, and then it guards nothing.
//
// ‼️ AND A PLANTED CANARY IS NOT A LEAK. The leak tests push a credential-SHAPED
// value through every surface on purpose, and those values carry the word
// CANARY so both readers can tell them apart from a real key. A real key never
// contains it.
